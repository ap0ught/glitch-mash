2. Low-vote filter (5 candidates) - gives new avatars exposure  
3. Medium-vote filter (5 candidates) - balances exposure with quality
```

**Significance**: Maintains algorithm fairness while scaling to thousands of avatars.

### Database Query Optimization

**Vote Counting**:
```sql
-- Optimized with proper indexing
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM glitchmash_votes WHERE win_id = ?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM glitchmash_votes WHERE lose_id = ?
```

**Avatar Selection**:
```sql
-- Uses compound indexes for performance
SELECT * FROM glitchmash_avatars 
WHERE is_active=1 AND votes < ? 
ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 5
```

### Caching Strategies

**Avatar Images**: Leverage CDN caching for frequently accessed avatar images.

**Vote Statistics**: Consider caching win ratios and vote counts with periodic refresh.

**Player Data**: Cache active avatar information to reduce database hits.

## Security Considerations

### Vote Integrity

**Cryptographic Signatures**: Each vote includes SHA1 hash preventing vote manipulation:
```php
$sig = substr(sha1($secret . '/' . $win_id . '/' . $lose_id . '/' . $voter_tsid), 0, 20);
```

**Deduplication**: Hash-based system prevents multiple votes on same matchup by same player.

**Token Validation**: All votes validated against cryptographic signature before processing.

### Authentication Security

**OAuth Token Storage**: Tokens stored securely and refreshed as needed.
